# Book-Recommendation-System
This project is done by using Book Recommendation Dataset from Kaggle. With the dataset in hand, I proceeded to implement collaborative filtering, a widely used technique in recommendation systems. Collaborative filtering analyzes user behavior to predict future preferences based on their interactions with items. For this project, cosine similarity emerged as the ideal metric for capturing the similarity between users' book preferences effectively.
One of the project's key milestones was the successful deployment of the Book Recommendation System on Streamlit Cloud. Here is the link of the webapp [https://book-recommendation-system.streamlit.app/](url)
